#Description: This is a simple choose your own adventure style game. It features ascii art and some fun illustrations to make it more engaging, too!
#I wish that this game turned out a bit more in-depth and lasted longer, but I spent a lot of the time focusing on quality over quantity and trying to
#perfect the ascii art and making sure there were absolutely no ways to break this game. I ended up using the try/except thing to display
#a message when someone tries to quit, because I didn't really have any errors pop up every so I made my own... Hope you enjoy!
